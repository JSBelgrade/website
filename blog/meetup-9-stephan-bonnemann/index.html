                    <p>After just a few months and a few meetups the idea of JS Belgrade has grown from &quot;a small meetup with a few local JS developers talking about some things that they use and like&quot; to something a bit more serious.
So far, we had 8 meetups with some great speakers (James Halliday - Substack, Gojko Adžić, Igor Terzić, Bogdan Gavrilović, Goran Gajić and Aleksandar Simović) and we also organized a first Node School event.
Most of the meetups were small, up to 30 people, except Angular meetup with almost 90 people. But in a near future we are planning some bigger meetups with very interesting guests from Europe.</p>
<p>First of those meetups is on August 8, 2015 at 5pm @ <a href="http://icthub.rs/">ICT Hub</a>.
You can RSVP <a href="http://www.meetup.com/JS-Belgrade-Meetup/events/223872076/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our first guest will be <a href="http://boennemann.me/">Stephan Bönnemann</a>.
Stephan is a web developer, who as of recently lives in Berlin, Germany. He tries to do things that help other people to build a better web. Be it open-source projects like <a href="http://hood.ie/">Hoodie</a>, tooling like <a href="https://github.com/semantic-release/">semantic-release</a>, as well as talks about these projects or community work and conferences like <a href="https://conc.at/">.concat()</a> and <a href="http://rejectjs.org/">Reject.JS</a>.</p>
<p>{<1>}<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/20fa532c739fbcbd35067c606ef9df4d0a44589b/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f70726f66696c655f696d616765732f3439363232393636373734313738323031362f46744c65576241362e6a706567" alt=""></p>
<p>On our meetup he&#39;ll speak about 3 themes - <a href="http://hood.ie/">Hoodie</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release">semantic-release</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hoodie">Hoodie</h3>
<p>Hoodie is an <a href="http://hood.ie/initiatives#offline-first">Offline First</a>, <a href="http://hood.ie/initiatives#nobackend">noBackend</a> architecture.</p>
<p>Its <a href="http://hood.ie/initiatives#dreamcode">Dreamcode API</a> gives you user signup and administration, data storage, loading, synchronisation and shares, emails and payments and can be extended with <a href="http://plugins.hood.ie/">plugins</a>. Hoodie is written in JavaScript and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> and relies on <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>.</p>
<p><em>// Description taken from <a href="http://hood.ie/">hood.ie</a> website</em></p>
<h3 id="npm">npm</h3>
<p>npm is lots of things.</p>
<ul>
<li>npm is the package manager for <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. It was created in 2009 as an <a href="https://github.com/npm/npm">open source project</a> to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code.</li>
<li>The npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, <a href="http://www.ember-cli.com/">front-end web apps</a>, <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">mobile apps</a>, <a href="https://tessel.io/">robots</a>, <a href="https://linerate.f5.com/">routers</a>, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community.</li>
<li>npm is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those packages.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>// Description taken from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> website</em></p>
<h3 id="semantic-release">semantic-release</h3>
<p>At its core semantic-release is a set of conventions that gives you entirely automated, semver-compliant package publishing. Luckily these conventions make sense on their own, like having meaningful commit messages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are over 160.000 packages on npm today, which makes it the biggest ecosystem out there. Using the right packages in your applications makes JavaScript a joy to develop. But if even immensely popular libraries fail to declare and communicate breaking changes, how can we trust over 50.000 strangers who developed all these modules?</p>
<p>Currently we can’t. Let me show you how you can write confidence-inspiring modules with breaking change detection and fully automated and tested releases including changelogs. Machines do a way better job with this than buggy humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>// Description taken from semantic-release README file, quote by Stephan</em></p>
<h3 id="rsvp">RSVP</h3>
<p>This event is free, but since we are limited to 150 people you need to RSVP <a href="http://www.meetup.com/JS-Belgrade-Meetup/events/223872076/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next-">What&#39;s next?</h2>
<p>We are preparing a few more great meetups. Our next guest will be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3xMyZH93i8">Martin Kleppe</a> on September 5, 2015. More info soon.</p>
