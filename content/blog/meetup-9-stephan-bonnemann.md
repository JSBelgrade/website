After just a few months and a few meetups the idea of JS Belgrade has grown from "a small meetup with a few local JS developers talking about some things that they use and like" to something a bit more serious.
So far, we had 8 meetups with some great speakers (James Halliday - Substack, Gojko Adžić, Igor Terzić, Bogdan Gavrilović, Goran Gajić and Aleksandar Simović) and we also organized a first Node School event.
Most of the meetups were small, up to 30 people, except Angular meetup with almost 90 people. But in a near future we are planning some bigger meetups with very interesting guests from Europe.

First of those meetups is on August 8, 2015 at 5pm @ [ICT Hub](http://icthub.rs/).
You can RSVP [here](http://www.meetup.com/JS-Belgrade-Meetup/events/223872076/).

Our first guest will be [Stephan Bönnemann](http://boennemann.me/).
Stephan is a web developer, who as of recently lives in Berlin, Germany. He tries to do things that help other people to build a better web. Be it open-source projects like [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/), tooling like [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/), as well as talks about these projects or community work and conferences like [.concat()](https://conc.at/) and [Reject.JS](http://rejectjs.org/).

On our meetup he'll speak about 3 themes - [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [semantic-release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release).

### Hoodie

Hoodie is an [Offline First](http://hood.ie/initiatives#offline-first), [noBackend](http://hood.ie/initiatives#nobackend) architecture.

Its [Dreamcode API](http://hood.ie/initiatives#dreamcode) gives you user signup and administration, data storage, loading, synchronisation and shares, emails and payments and can be extended with [plugins](http://plugins.hood.ie/). Hoodie is written in JavaScript and [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) and relies on [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/).

### npm

npm is lots of things.

- npm is the package manager for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). It was created in 2009 as an [open source project](https://github.com/npm/npm) to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code.
- The npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, [front-end web apps](http://www.ember-cli.com/), [mobile apps](http://cordova.apache.org/), [robots](https://tessel.io/), [routers](https://linerate.f5.com/), and countless other needs of the JavaScript community.
- npm is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those packages.

### semantic-release

At its core semantic-release is a set of conventions that gives you entirely automated, semver-compliant package publishing. Luckily these conventions make sense on their own, like having meaningful commit messages.

> There are over 160.000 packages on npm today, which makes it the biggest ecosystem out there. Using the right packages in your applications makes JavaScript a joy to develop. But if even immensely popular libraries fail to declare and communicate breaking changes, how can we trust over 50.000 strangers who developed all these modules?
>
> Currently we can’t. Let me show you how you can write confidence-inspiring modules with breaking change detection and fully automated and tested releases including changelogs. Machines do a way better job with this than buggy humans.

### RSVP

## What's next?

We are preparing a few more great meetups. Our next guest will be [Martin Kleppe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3xMyZH93i8) on September 5, 2015. More info soon.
